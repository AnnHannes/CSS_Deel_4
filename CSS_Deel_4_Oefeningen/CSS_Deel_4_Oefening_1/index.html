            <h1>Webtrends</h1>
            <p>Staying current on web design trends is crucial to the success of your website. A lot changes every twelve months in terms of popularity with visuals, algorithm updates, and best practices.</p>
            <p>A website that looks sleek and modern today could look outdated and cheesy in just a few months’ time. That’s why knowing the difference between a trend in the industry and a passing fad is so important when designing your website — you want to ensure that your design will look great for several years and not reminiscent of a Geocities message board from 1996.</p>
            <p>Next year will be all about delivering on user experience: web design trends will prioritize speed and mobile design, eye-catching simple designs with asymmetrical layouts, immersive video backgrounds, and more.</p>

                    <h2>Broken Grid</h2>
                    <p>Web design trends are all about thinking outside the box, or rather, the grid. Broken grid and asymmetrical designs are leaving their mark across the web design industry in a big way. In spite of the push from many web designers towards flat, fast, minimalist design, there’s also a large contingent of designers advocating for the fresh, striking look of broken layouts.</p>

                    <h2>Video Backgrounds</h2>
                    <p>In spite of the minimalist, quick-loading, flat design trends, video backgrounds are still incredibly popular as a trend going into the new yaer. You might think with speed being such a huge factor this year that videos would bog down a site too much, but, interestingly, video backgrounds have been shown to increase conversions.</p>

                    <h2>Chatbots/Machine Learning</h2>
                    <p>Over the last several years, interacting and communicating with bots has become more and more normal. Bots, or chatbots, are becoming increasingly common on websites and micro-interactions across digital media. It’s likely that you spoke with one the last time you called your mobile service provider.</p>

                    <h2>Immersive web</h2>
                    <p>The immersive web means virtual world experiences hosted through the browser. This covers entire virtual reality (VR) experiences surfaced in the browser or in VR enabled headsets like Google's Daydream, Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality Headsets, as well as augmented reality experiences developed for AR-enabled mobile devices.</p>
